# Titanic Data Analysis — Pandas Fundamental Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is my **second Python project** as part of my **AI Engineering learning roadmap**, where the focus is on working with **real-world tabular data using Pandas**.

The goal of this project is to learn how to:
- Load CSV datasets
- Inspect and understand data structure
- Clean raw data
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

This project represents the transition from **pure Python logic** to **data-oriented programming**, which is a core skill for AI Engineers.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how Pandas represents data as DataFrames
- Explore datasets using inspection methods
- Identify missing values and incorrect data types
- Apply basic data cleaning techniques
- Prepare clean data for future machine learning tasks

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Pandas fundamentals
- CSV file handling
- Data inspection (`head`, `columns`, `shape`, `dtypes`)
- Handling missing values
- Dropping unnecessary columns
- Saving processed datasets
- Project structuring for data workflows

## 🔍 Work Summary

### Day 1 — Data Inspection
- Loaded the Titanic CSV dataset using Pandas
- Inspected:
  - First few rows
  - Column names
  - Dataset shape
  - Data types
- Built understanding of the dataset structure before making changes

### Day 2 — Data Cleaning
- Identified missing values
- Filled missing values:
  - `Age` → median
  - `Embarked` → mode
- Dropped unused columns:
  - `Cabin`
  - `Ticket`
- Verified data integrity after cleaning
- Saved cleaned dataset for future use
